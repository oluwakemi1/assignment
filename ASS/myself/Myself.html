                <p>My name is Abdulbaqqy. I'm 17years old. I Attended Santa Maria College, Mushin. Some of my favorite things to do is to read, listen to music, play video games and ride public transportation (buses and bikes). These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily. My career aspirations is to become either an aeronautical engineer or a web developer. I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members, especially my mom, as a guiding figure in life. Favorite shows of mine include Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Flash, Game of thrones, Star, Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins' and Dives), Hustle, and Chopped (yes, the majority of those are British TV shows). Just a few things about me. Thank You.</p>
