          <h2> Rice </h2>

        <h3> List of ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
  	    <li> Measuring cup </li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> Saucepan with lid </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Rice </li>
        <li>Wooden spoon</li>
        <li>Fork</li>
    </ul>


      <h2>Steps:</h2><ol><li><strong>Boil water and add salt</strong><br>Pour water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon salt into the water.</li><li><strong>Pour in rice</strong><br>Add it to the boiling water.</li><li><strong>Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice</strong><br>Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.</li><li><strong>Cover the pot and simmer</strong><br>Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.</li><li><strong>Fluff rice with a fork</strong><br>Just before serving, gently fluff the rice</a> with a fork to separate the grains.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Tip: </strong>Don’t uncover the saucepan or stir the rice during cooking. If it’s done before you’re ready to serve it, place a folded towel over the saucepan, replace the lid, and set aside. The towel will absorb excess moisture and condensation, helping prevent overcooked and mushy rice.</li></ol>

          <h2> Yam Fries</h2>

        <h3> List of ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
  	    <li> 1/2 medium tuber of yam , peeled, cut into fries and rinsed </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp plain flour </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp water </li>
        <li> 1 large egg </li>
        <li> 1/4 red bell pepper very finely diced </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Oil for deep frying </li>
    </ul>


      <h2>Steps:</h2><ol><li>Place yam fries in pot, cover with water and bring to the boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until yam is cooked through. Make sure it is not too soft or it all goes mushy. Mine took about 10 mins of simmering. </li> <li>In a large bowl, mix flour and water together into a paste before adding in the egg, pepper and salt. Gently mix in the yam fries and coat them with the batter.</li>Heat the oil on medium high heat until it is hot enough for deep frying and using a spoon, scoop one yam fry at a time along with some batter and drop into the oil. Don't put too many in the pot at the same time. Fry until golden, turn them over and repeat on the other side.</li><li>Remove yam fries from the oil unto paper towel to drain the excess oil, store in a warm place and cook the rest of the fries.
